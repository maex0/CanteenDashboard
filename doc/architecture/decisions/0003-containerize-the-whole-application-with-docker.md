# 3. Containerize the whole Application with Docker

**Date:** 2024-05-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project needs a consistent and replicable development environment that allows seamless deployment across different environments. Developers face challenges related to dependencies, inconsistent runtime environments, and configuration mismatches, which can affect productivity and stability. Docker, a leading containerization platform, offers an effective way to package the application and its dependencies into lightweight containers, ensuring consistent performance across environments.

**Key motivations for this decision include:**

1. **Consistency:** Docker containers offer consistent environments, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem and making the development, testing, and deployment processes more predictable.

2. **Scalability:** Containers provide the flexibility to scale the application horizontally or vertically with minimal configuration changes.

3. **Resource Efficiency:** Docker containers are lightweight compared to full virtual machines, reducing resource consumption while maintaining isolation.

4. **Rapid Deployment:** Applications packaged in containers can be deployed quickly due to their isolated nature and pre-defined configuration.

5. **Microservices Architecture:** Docker facilitates the management and orchestration of multiple services, aligning well with microservices architecture.

## Decision

The entire application will be containerized using Docker. This includes both the frontend and backend services, packaged along with their dependencies and runtime configurations in Docker containers. The configuration files (Dockerfiles, Compose files) will define the application's container structure, ensuring reliable and predictable builds.

## Consequences

1. **Positive Impacts:**

   - **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Developers can build and run containers across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) without compatibility issues.
   - **Deployment Speed:** Pre-built images and efficient caching mechanisms enable faster deployments.
   - **Developer Productivity:** Developers can easily switch between different services and environments by sharing common Docker configurations.
   - **Scalability:** Containers are easier to orchestrate, whether deploying on local clusters or using cloud orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

2. **Negative Impacts:**
   - **Learning Curve:** Developers unfamiliar with Docker will require some time to learn containerization concepts and best practices.
   - **Increased Storage Usage:** Docker images and containers can consume significant disk space over time.
   - **Network Complexity:** Applications with complex networking requirements might need careful planning to ensure containers can communicate as expected.
