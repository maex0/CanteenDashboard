# 2. Use Next.js for frontend and backend

**Date:** 2024-05-06

## Status:

Accepted

## Context:

The team (myself) identified a need for a framework that can seamlessly handle both server-rendered and client-rendered content while simplifying the development process. The current project requires a flexible, performant, and feature-rich framework to build a robust web application that can deliver exceptional user experiences with minimal configuration.

**Key motivations for this decision include:**

1. **Unified Development:** Next.js enables the development of both frontend and backend functionality in one unified environment, streamlining the development process.

2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Server-side rendering ensures faster page loads and improved SEO by pre-rendering pages before sending them to the client.

3. **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Next.js supports static site generation, which is beneficial for pages that don't change frequently and require optimal loading speed.

4. **Built-In API Routes:** API routes in Next.js allow seamless implementation of backend APIs within the same application, eliminating the need for a separate server setup.

5. **Flexibility:** Next.js is versatile, supporting incremental static regeneration and dynamic routing, catering to various web application requirements.

6. **Community Support:** Next.js has a good community and ample documentation, ensuring reliable support and quick resolution of challenges.

### Personal Motivation:

I have experience with React but not with Next.js (which is build on top of React). I want to learn Next.js because of its cool features mentioned above and I want to use it for private projects.

## Decision:

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) should be used as the primary framework for the frontend and backend of the application. Its features, including server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and optimized development experience, align well with the project's requirements and objectives.

## Consequences:

1. **Positive Impacts:**

   - **Improved SEO and Performance:** Server-side rendering and static site generation enhance user experience with faster load times and better SEO.
   - **Development Efficiency:** A unified framework simplifies the development pipeline by reducing context switching between frontend and backend stacks.
   - **Scalability and Maintainability:** Next.js's features, like dynamic routing and static regeneration, aid in scaling the application while maintaining performance.
   - **Developer Productivity:** The framework provides excellent developer experience with features like fast refresh, extensive documentation, and TypeScript support.

2. **Negative Impacts:**
   - **Learning Curve:** Developers may need to adjust to Next.js conventions and SSR/SSG paradigms if they are new to the framework.
   - **Lock-In:** Utilizing built-in features like API routes may introduce some degree of lock-in to the Next.js ecosystem.
