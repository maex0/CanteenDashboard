# 5. Use Prisma as the ORM for Database Management

**Date:** 2024-05-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application requires efficient and consistent database management for storing cat images with associated boolean values. The team seeks an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies database interactions and provides a clear schema structure. Prisma is a modern ORM that integrates well with TypeScript and JavaScript, offering features like type safety, schema migrations, and a streamlined development workflow.

**Key motivations for this decision include:**

1. **Type Safety:** Prisma generates types based on the database schema, reducing runtime errors and improving development efficiency.

2. **Schema-Driven Approach:** Prisma's declarative schema definition file allows clear visualization and consistency across different environments.

3. **Development Workflow:** Prisma provides CLI tools and migrations that simplify database version control and help synchronize schema changes.

4. **Database Compatibility:** Prisma supports various relational databases, including PostgreSQL, making it adaptable for different use cases.

## Decision

**Prisma** will be used as the ORM layer for managing database interactions in the application. Prisma will be integrated with the PostgreSQL database hosted in a Docker container. The Prisma schema will include a table for cat images with columns for storing image data (or file path) and a boolean value. The Prisma Client will handle data queries and mutations.

## Consequences

1. **Positive Impacts:**

   - **Development Efficiency:** Prisma's type-safe queries and schema-based approach reduce development time and errors.
   - **Clear Schema Management:** Prisma migrations and declarative schema files make it easier to track and maintain schema changes.
   - **Compatibility:** Prisma's compatibility with PostgreSQL and other relational databases ensures flexibility if the project evolves.

2. **Negative Impacts:**
   - **Learning Curve:** Developers unfamiliar with Prisma will need to learn its schema syntax and unique query/migration features.
   - **Tooling Dependency:** Some database-specific features may require custom Prisma client configurations or additional tooling.
   - **Performance Considerations:** In certain cases, Prisma's abstraction may introduce performance trade-offs compared to raw SQL queries.

By using Prisma, the project will have a more streamlined, efficient, and consistent approach to database management. This decision will be revisited if the application's database management needs significantly change.
